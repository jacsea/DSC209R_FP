    <h2>Inspecting U.S. Voter Turnout</h2>
    <h3><i>a project by Matt Zidell, Jacob Sease, and Dimas Molina</i></h3>

        The citizens of the United States of America have the privilege of making their voice heard in the country's democracy by casting votes for elected officials that represent them in Washington D.C.
        As alluded to, not every one has that privilege, such as those under 18 years old and those who are non-citizens. This article only analyzes the voting eligible population (VEP), those who are eligible to cast votes, 
        and their turnout rate from 1980 to 2022. Take a look below, select an election year with our slider, and hover over any state to see for yourself how a state's VEP and turnout rate has varied by year (zoom in with 
        your mousepad to see states that are smaller):

<h2>Write-up</h2>
<p style = "text-indent: 2em;">
    In this prototype, we decided to present the VEP and VEP turnout rate statistics for each U.S state by 
    using a Mapbox map and displaying these values through an interactive tooltip. We also analyzed
    the statistics from various election years between 1980 and 2022 using a slider that highlights every 
    midterm and presidential election year. In addition, we provided readers the option to not
    just analyze the statistics for a specific year, but also to analyze them over the years covered in
    our data. By clicking on a state, readers can see a line chart of how VEP and VEP turnout rate varied
    over the years.

    The most challenging part of our project will be designing visuals that maintain the right
    balance between clarity and depth. Although we are only focusing on two core statistics, they still
    create many possible angles for analysis and therefore, it is important we do not overwhelm readers with too much
    information at once. Our goal is to build an interactive storytelling experience that is simple,
    intuitive, and consistent, requiring careful decisions about how each element is styled and how the data is presented.
    Ultimately, our challenge lies in making the interface feel effortless for readers, even though the design
    work behind it is complex. <br><br>
